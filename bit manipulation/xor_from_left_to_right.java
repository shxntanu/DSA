// The modulus of 4 (n % 4) is considered in this code because it helps identify a pattern in the XOR of consecutive numbers. The XOR pattern repeats every 4 numbers, and by checking the remainder when dividing n by 4, the code can determine the appropriate XOR value for the range.

// Here's a brief explanation of each case:

// If n % 4 == 0, it means that n is a multiple of 4. In this case, the XOR of numbers from 1 to n is n itself.

// If n % 4 == 1, it means that n leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. In this case, the XOR of numbers from 1 to n is always 1.

// If n % 4 == 2, it means that n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. In this case, the XOR of numbers from 1 to n is n + 1.

// If n % 4 == 3, it means that n leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. In this case, the XOR of numbers from 1 to n is always 0.

// These cases represent the XOR pattern for consecutive numbers and are based on mathematical observations. By exploiting this pattern, the code can efficiently calculate the XOR of a range of consecutive numbers without explicitly XORing each element individually.


// The XOR pattern repeats every 4 numbers due to the bitwise XOR properties. Let's take a closer look at the XOR operations:

// XOR of two equal numbers is 0: a ^ a = 0.
// XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself: a ^ 0 = a.
// XOR is commutative: a ^ b = b ^ a.
// Now, let's observe the XOR pattern for consecutive numbers:

// XOR of 1 and 2: 1 ^ 2 = 3
// XOR of 3 and 4: 3 ^ 4 = 7
// XOR of 5 and 6: 5 ^ 6 = 3 (observed pattern repeats)
// Notice that the XOR result repeats after every 4 numbers. This happens because XORing with the same value twice results in 0, and XORing with 0 doesn't change the value. Therefore, the pattern of XOR values becomes predictable, and it repeats every 4 consecutive numbers.

// In the code you provided, the makeXor function leverages this pattern by calculating the XOR for specific cases based on the remainder of n when divided by 4. This allows for a more efficient calculation of the XOR of a range of consecutive numbers without explicitly XORing each element individually.
